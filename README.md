# Block System

A simple drag-and-drop block-based web development system where users can build HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code using pre-made and custom blocks. This system allows users to visually arrange blocks and generate code for their projects. The output is displayed in real-time with an option to preview the result.

## Features

- **Drag and Drop Interface**: Easily drag pre-made blocks (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) into the workspace.
- **Custom Block Creation**: Create custom HTML, CSS, and JavaScript blocks and add them to the blocks panel.
- **Code Generation**: Automatically generates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code based on the blocks arranged in the workspace.
- **Code Preview**: View the generated web page in a live preview area with applied styles and functionality.
- **Tabbed Output View**: Toggle between the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code outputs to inspect the generated code.

## How to Use
